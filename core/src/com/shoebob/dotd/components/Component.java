    Essentially a placeholder class for components to inherit from; simple OO enforcement
    COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE METHODS, should be similar to structs, but java doesn't have them :(
    Components should always be initialized with default values that should be eye-catching - use broken texture,
    weird numbers, etc.
